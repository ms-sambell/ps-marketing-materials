# ps-marketing-materials

Creating a repository to share PsRules / PsDocs marketing materials (ppt, blog posts, etc). By creating a GitHub repository with this content we could eventually make this public and enable people to see stories / journeys and have content to sell the tool internally. It could also become a library for where to find the whole PS ecosystem etc (just an idea) and any relevant guides / documents created so far.
